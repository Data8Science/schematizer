A set of python modules implementing treaps is provided.

Treaps perform most operations in O(log2n) time, and are innately sorted.
They're very nice for keeping a collection of values that needs to
always be sorted, or for optimization problems in which you need to find
the p best values out of q, when p is much smaller than q.

Modules are provided for both treaps that enforce uniqueness, and treaps that allow duplicates.

Pure python versions are included, as are Cython-enhanced versions for performance.

Release 1.22 is pylint'd and is known to run on at least CPython 2, CPython 3 and Pypy 1.4.1.
